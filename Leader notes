* write an outline of what the app will do.
Will upload this on friday.


* split up into UI, mobile frontend, and backend sub-groups
UI - Luis, Shane
mobile frontend - Brand
backend - Bryan


* UI people should begin designs using mocking tool (say https://proto.io/) to design every screen ahead of time

* backend and frontend need to write up every API call between them

* frontend dev needs to design the datastructure for quizzes and make sure it does everything the UI needs in terms of data

all of that provides the basis for the glue between the sub-projects 
(i.e. how each part will work with the others) we will then begin working on our own things.
